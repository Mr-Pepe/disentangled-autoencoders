# Learning Interpretable Physical Variables from Image Sequences


## Walks over latent variables

A sample of 2000 sequences was used to calculate the latent encoding for the three architectures.
While holding five of the six variables constant at the mean of the observed values for one model, one latent 
variable is sampled between its observed minimum and maximum value. This shows the influence of 
one latent variable on the generated output image.
